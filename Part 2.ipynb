    "In the end the goal likely leans towards a profitability assessment. As such, designing an experiment that enables us to see whether reducing the friction for drivers to more freely pass from one side of the city to the other would be important. An indicator of how reliable the service is ties to the renevue generated. Another interesting metric to track would be the surge pricing applied to each side of the city, in theory the larger supply of driver labor should allow for reduced surge pricing amongst both populations in the city"

    "a) For this experiment, I would use weekends in order to test the effect of paying for tolls, reason being that this is a time when the usage is more similar between the cities. I would offer 50% of the rideshare providers in each city access to the cash reimbursement program so that we can measure the response among population from each. I would track the following:\n",
    "- The amount of time the providers spent at both cities. \n",
    "- Wait time of the clients\n",
    "- The cost per mile of the subsequent rides provided. \n",
    "- The revenue generated by the providers during the period. \n",
    "- Establish that H0, the null hypothesis is that the providers don't spend more time in each city even with the program in place.\n",

    "b) the statistical tests I would employ to verify impact would be to check the p-value of the wait times, trip cost per mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) In order to guide the product team from these results I would share the insights regarding how the A/B test impacted the behavior of the providers. If it turns out that the toll reimbursement ends up driving a statistically significant impact to the the measure metrics, we could discuss options regarding how we communicate this to the providers so that they are more encouraged to pay the toll to pick up work or consider payin this fee for them.\n",
